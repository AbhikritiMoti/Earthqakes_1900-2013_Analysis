# Earthqakes_1900-2013_Analysis

## Introduction
Earthquakes are one of the most significant natural hazards, causing loss of life and destruction of infrastructure. As earthquakes can occur at any time and in any place, it is important to understand their patterns and characteristics to prepare for potential disasters.The project provides a detailed analysis of the data, including the distribution of earthquakes across the globe, the magnitude of the earthquakes, and the frequency of earthquakes over time. The visualization also highlights the most earthquake-prone regions, allowing for a better understanding of the risk associated with earthquakes. Through the dashboard, we can gain insights into the patterns and trends of earthquakes over the years and use this information to better prepare and mitigate the impact of such natural disasters in the future.

## Analysis
The key points for analysis are as follows:
- What are the most frequently affected Earthquake zones?
- Total Earthquake by Year and Type
- Frequency of Earthquakes by Month and Type
- Earthquake Magnitude and Depth Distribution
- Relationship Between Depth and Magnitude
